Its genesis dates back to 1st October 1917, with the title of \u201cSindh National Arts \nCollege Hyderabad\u201d having being contemplated by the International Theosophical Society. The \ncrucial role in running the International Theosophical Society was played by its second president, \nDr. Annie Be sant, a well -known educationist, orator, political and social figure of the undivided \nIndian sub -continent. Another famous figure Dr. Ernest Egerton Wood, the secretary to National \nEducational Trust, continued \u201cNational Educational Movement\u201d activities. He  appealed through \nthe newspapers for the establishment of new educational institutes in India.  \n  \nSince there was no college in Hyderabad Sindh, the students who wanted to continue higher \neducation had to go to far off cities like Bombay. The first response of enormous contribution \nappeared from a youth of Sindh with a donation of Rs. 20,000/= on a con dition to establish a \ncollege in Hyderabad Sindh. Another important figure among the city\u2019s aristocracy was Diwan \nDayaram Gidumal, a judge by profession. He was the driving factor behind the establishment of a \ncollege in Hyderabad. Dr. Wood landed in Hyder abad, Sindh, on August 24, 1917, after a long \njourney from Madras. The people of Hyderabad Sindh gave a large sum of money, estimated to be \nover Rs. 5000/= in less than a week. The donation was quite enough to launch the institute. Dr. \nWood, within five we eks, purchased all necessary furniture, books, equipment, etc., and hired the \nstaff to run the institute. The college\u2019s location was decided on amid the city\u2019s scenic \nsurroundings. Seth Pertab Rai Manghar Singh and a few others contributed their best piece  of 64 \nacres of cultivated land for this beautiful deed. The date of the college\u2019s Foundation was chosen to \ncoincide with Dr. Besant\u2019s birthday, 1st October 1917. Dr. Wood was appointed its founder \nPrincipal. The National Educational Trust provided the initial funding for the college. Later, in 1921, \nthe college was given to the \u201cDiwanMetharamDarmada Trust\u201d (DMD), which was run by \nDiwanDayaramGidumal, who provided Rs.100000/= for the college\u2019s affiliation with Bombay \nUniversity. After DiwanD ayaramGidumal\u2019s death, the college was renamed D. G. National College \nHyderabad.  \nThe college initially began its journey as intermediate Arts College, soon the courses were offered \nin B.Sc. in Industrial Science; B. A. in Agriculture and Political Science; and B.Com. In June 1927, B. \nA. (Hons.) in English, History, Economics and Philosophy were also offered. In 1934, Intermediate \nscience classes were also started, which made the college a Science College. In 1940, there was \nthe commencement of M. A. classes in Sindhi Literature. In 194 5, classes for B.Sc. were started in \nZoology, Botany and Chemistry. Later on, due to political turmoil in the Indian sub -continent, the \ncollege was closed. Its faculty and other staff migrated from Hyderabad to other parts of India, \nleaving behind the inst itute deserted.  \nThe second phase of this historic educational institution began after the establishment of Pakistan.  \n D. G. National College Hyderabad, due to this voluntary departure of its original owners, was taken \nover by the Government of Sindh. It decided to reopen it on 21st June 1948 with the same name \u201cD. \nG. National Government College Hyderabad\u201d. Prof. Dr. Adri an Duarte was appointed as its \nPrincipal. Dr. Duarte had to rebuild the college again from the ground level. The extraordinary \nleadership of the appointed Principal was instrumental in the re - birth of this fantastic institute. The \nre-birth of this gloriou s institute took place under the remarkable leadership with 224 students on \nthe roll and a faculty comprised of 6 professors, 15 Lecturers and three demonstrators.  \nThere was co -education till 1952 -. as there was no college for the girls. On 9th April 1949, the \ncollege was renamed \u201cGovernment Arts College, Hyderabad\u201d. Later, on 7th March 1951, the \ncollege was renamed \u201cGovernment College Hyderabad\u201d through a government  resolution and was \nallowed to teach up to B. Sc. level in affiliation with Sindh University. Within the next few years, \nthere was a significant increase in the number of science students. During the academic session \n1952 -53, the enrolment surpassed 1000.  \nGovernment College Hyderabad has the honour of starting post -graduate classes in Arts and \nScience for the first time after Sindh University was shifted from Karachi to Hyderabad. Its \nprofessors were given the status of part - time Professors of the Universi ty. The commencement of \nM. A. (Urdu & English) and M.Sc. (Physics; Chemistry; Mathematics and Statistics) in I991 and later \nM.Sc. in Zoology and Botany in 1993 ushered a new era in the history of this institution.
